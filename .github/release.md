### "Why should I use this?"

Here's some [reasons why you should use Oculus Dummy](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusDummy#reasons-to-use-oculus-dummy) and some [reasons you shouldn't use Oculus Dummy](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusDummy#reasons-not-to-use-oculus-dummy-a-sorta-to-do-list).

In summary, it just depends on what you're looking for, if you're looking for a less resource hungry replacement for the Oculus client, ***with*** app updates and settings, this isn't what you're looking for, at least not now.

But if those things aren't important to you, you don't mind switching between the two, or you don't care because you use Oculus Killer with Revive anyway, this might be what you've been looking for!

### Installation

1. Open your file explorer and go to `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-client\resources`.

2. Rename the `app.asar` file to something else, I prefer "`app.asar.bak`" for clarity, though it doesn't matter.

3. Download [this](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusDummy/releases/latest/download/app.asar), and move it to the same folder.

4. Enjoy the extra bit of performance! ðŸ˜Š

### Uninstallation

1. Open your file explorer and go to `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-client\resources`.

2. Delete the `app.asar` file.

3. Rename your backup file (`app.asar.bak`) back to "`app.asar`".

4. Make sure to give Oculus Dummy a kiss before you leave it, it still loves you! ðŸ˜”ðŸ’•
