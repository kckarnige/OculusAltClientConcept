### "Why should I use this?"

Here are some [reasons why you should use Oculus Dummy](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusDummy#reasons-to-use-oculus-dummy) and some [reasons you shouldn't use Oculus Dummy](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusDummy#reasons-not-to-use-oculus-dummy-a-sorta-to-do-list).

In summary, it just depends on what you're looking for, if you're looking for a less resource hungry replacement for the Oculus client, ***with*** all the features of the official client, ~~stop being picky~~ you're outta luck.

But if that isn't important to you, you don't mind switching between the two, or you don't care because you don't use Oculus Killer, this might be what you've been looking for!

### Installation

1. Open your file explorer and go to `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-client\resources`.

2. Rename the `app.asar` file to something else, I prefer "`app.asar.bak`" for clarity, though it doesn't matter.

3. Download [this](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusDummy/releases/latest/download/app.asar), and move it to the same folder.

4. Enjoy the extra bit of performance! ðŸ˜Š

### Uninstallation

1. Open your file explorer and go to `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-client\resources`.

2. Delete the `app.asar` file.

3. Rename your backup file (`app.asar.bak`) back to "`app.asar`".

4. Make sure to give Oculus Dummy a kiss before you leave it, it'll miss you! ðŸ˜”ðŸ’•
