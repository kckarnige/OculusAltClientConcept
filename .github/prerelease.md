### Installation

1. Open your file explorer and go to `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-client\resources`.

2. Rename the `app.asar` file to something else, I prefer "`app.asar.bak`" for clarity, though it doesn't matter.

3. Download [this](https://github.com/kckarnige/OculusDummy/releases/latest/download/app.asar), and move it to the same folder.

4. Enjoy the extra bit of performance! ðŸ˜Š

### Uninstallation

1. Open your file explorer and go to `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Support\oculus-client\resources`.

2. Delete the `app.asar` file.

3. Rename your backup file (`app.asar.bak`) back to "`app.asar`".

4. Make sure to give Oculus Dummy a kiss before you leave it, it still loves you! ðŸ˜”ðŸ’•
